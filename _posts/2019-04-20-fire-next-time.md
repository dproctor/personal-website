Amazing book, directly inspired Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me,
and similar style of book. Baldwin is such a talented writer, and his
spirituality just bleeds off the page. Talks in really deep terms how racism
hurts all of us, and that white America's only hope for redemption is justice
for blacks. Still feels super relevant today.
