Amazing book. Felt like public policy companion to "The Fire Next Time".
Discusses cost of racism to all of society, including white majority. Racism
keeps us from solving important problems, and obviously holds us back. Visceral
example commonly referred to throughout the book is closure of public swimming
pools across the South, when the alternative was to allow blacks to also use
them. Racism directly made everyone poorer, i.e. fewer public
assets.\r\n\r\nStriking discussion of racism in the run up to 2008 financial
crisis. Common narrative of irresponsible (black and brown) poor people buying
homes they couldn't afford misses explicit and implicit racism in the process.
Blacks were like 100% more likely to be put into shitty subprime loans when
controlling for credit scores. Clearly exploitative, as many were qualified for
prime loans, lied to by fiduciaries. Also, a large fraction of bad mortgages
weren't primary loans but actually refinances, home equity loans. So, these
people were already in sustainable mortgages, and tricked into new bad loans
that ultimately led to them losing their homes.
