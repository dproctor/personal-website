Strange history of the Christian world. Very cursory, which is probably
necessary to cover such a broad topic. Treats people from where there come
from, doesn't try to put a modern perspecitve on it. Strangely barely touches
on the life and times of Jesus.

Tries to cover so much that it can only skim over everything. Overall, makes a
decent case for the modern world being fundamentally built on Christian
foundations, and for Christian ideology being our society's "default", though I
thought that most people took that for granted.
