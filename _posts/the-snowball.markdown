Warren Buffet is a profoundly weird person. emotionally stunted, makes
instrusive demands on those around him. doesn't seem able to connect
emotionally with his family. strikes me as kind of a sad life. 

But, also impressively principled. Always very conscious of the long-term,
doesn't trade off his principles for anything. Very aware of his public image;
makes me wonder about the accuracy of the depiction. To what extent was he able
to shape the biography's narrative? Did he have any editorial control?

importance of emotional resilience, disattachment in investing

vindication of my investing approach, broad diversification plus some modest leverage

how does buffet's aversion to new technologies account for the fact that there
is tremendous turnover in the largest companies. i.e. if you're not buying new
companies, you're missing out on trememdous amounts of value creation.
