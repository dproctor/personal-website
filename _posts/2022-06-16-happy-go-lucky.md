David Sedaris's new collection of essays is similar to his previous works.
I really appreciate his style.
He reliably provides perspectives on society that are simultaneously perceptive, humane, and hilarious.
A deep sense of decency shines through his work.
I admire his curiosity for places and people, and the way that he uses his caustic wit to disarm the listener and to communicate universal truths.
