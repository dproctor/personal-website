title:  "On Statistical Nihilism"
date: 
---

- we now think that quantitative is only legitimate way of gaining knowledge
- scientific method is incomplete -- it's not just statistics. basic
  understanding of theory -> prediction -> statistics, elides the question of
  where the theory comes from. theory generation is an art, and crucially
  important. when we lose sight/appreciation for that, we become dumber.
- quality of theory generation has declined. hard to find many examples of
  writers elevated like
  - Federalist papers
  - Hannah Arendt
  - Rousseau
  - David Graeber
  - Thomas Acquainas
- multiple epistemologies are crucial for progress. the qaulitative is needed
  for theory generation, then statistics necessary to impose constraints. but
  statistics only is empty, terrible for generating ideas.
- we also do a disservice by expecting that all arguments are acoompanied by
  statistics, because that often means that those statistics are done poorly,
  lowers the crediibilty of statistics overall. Gate keeps many people from
  contributing. Ideally, qualitative/quantitative should be in conversation,
  part of same public debate even if not articulated by the same people.
