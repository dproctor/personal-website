A detailed account of Jim Simons' development of Renaissance Technologies,
based on many interviews. It is impressive that the author was even able to
write this book, given how secretive Ren Tech is. This left me feeling less
impressed with Ren Tech. There is no doubt that it is a collection of talented
people, but it seems clear that they've done nothing more than build a machine
capable of systematically exploiting psychological biases of small investors
(they make their money from "dentists"). It does feel like an extraordinary
waste of talent.

Unsurprisingly, there also seem to be a bunch of highly unpleasant people
associated with the firm.

It was an interesting claim that part of the reason that the firm recruits
non-finance people is that they are less likely to go to competitors, which is
important for safeguarding confidential trading strategies.
