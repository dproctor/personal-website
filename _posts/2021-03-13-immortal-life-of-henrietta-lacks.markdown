One of my favorite non-fiction/science books. Tells the story of poor black
woman in Baltimore, Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells became the source for
the first stable human culture, enabling much of modern pharmaceutical tests.
This happened at Johns Hopkins, and a central theme of the book is the
unequal/exploitative treatment of minorities by the hospital and accompanying
lack of trust among those groups of medical authorities. Even 50 years later,
people still remember the "night doctors", and the haughty attitude of
Hopkins doctors towards those same minorities (and Lacks's children) was
shocking.\r\n\r\nLacks's cell culture was so strong that there was a major
scandal decades later when some scientist discovered that essentially all cell
cultures in use at that time were actually the Lacks culture, as the culture
had gotten into and dominated those other cultures without the researchers'
knowledge.

Amazing balance of fascinating pop science account with super
relevant sociological study.
