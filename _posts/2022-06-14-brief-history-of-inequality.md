This book feels disjointed to me.
In the introduction, Piketty claims to be writing a history of inequality in the past few centuries, but what follows is much more a polemic; a political endorsement of progressive policies that can help to make our world more equal.
For what it's worth, I generally agree with his ideas, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting from the book.

I also have a hard time reconciling the central thesis of the book, that the world has been getting more equal, across many dimensions, since the 19th century, with my understanding of his argument from "Capital in the 21st Century," which seemed to paint a much less optimistic vision of how fundamental economic economic forces have been moving the world in a plutocratic direction, with the one exception of the post-war period.
One interpretation is that the long term trend (since the end of the 18th century) is towards increasing equality across various dimensions and that the regression since 1980 is an exception.
He also seems more optimistic that progress is possible and that the dynamics of capital discussed in "Capital in the 21st Century" are not determinative.
