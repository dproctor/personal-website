Adam Tooze's investigation into the economic context that gave shape to the
Third Reich's preparations for, and execution of, the Second World War. It is
clearly a wonderfully researched work and, typically for Tooze, effectively
balances detailed statistics with a cohesive, insightful and novel narrative.

Some things that stood out to me:

- The successful Blitzkreig invasion of France and the low countries hinged,
  not on German technological sophistication or quality of the Wehrmacht, but
  on successful Napoleonic tactics (achieve overwhelming force in one area) in
  driving through the Ardenne, which enabled encirclement of Allied forces,
  surrender of more than a million soldiers. If the Allied forces had responded
  optimally, they could have pincered the German front and likely ended the
  war.

- There was never a coherent German strategy that had a reasonable chance of
  victory. Hitler was just an an anti-Semitic paranoid, and saw a worldwide
  Jewish conspiracy that was seeking to crush the German state, and so thought
  war was inevitable; it was just a matter of choosing the time for it that
  maximized Germany's (slim) chances of victory.

- Hitler opted for invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) to
  obtain raw materials necessary for the war effort (Ukrainian wheat, oil from
  the Caucauses) rather than obtain those by negotation with the Soviet Union
  because doing so would have put Germany into a subservient position to the
  Soviet Union. This is a contrast to the way that Great Britain and the
  western alliance sold off everything to secure American backing of the war
  effort.

- German industrial leaders doubled down on their suport for the Third Reich
  despite the failing war effort out of fear for their personal positions were
  the Red Army to conquer Germany and the communist Soviet Union come to power
  in Germany.
