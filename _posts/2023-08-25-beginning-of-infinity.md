Recommended by a couple of guys at Doug's Palantir Arlberg Club retreat, who
were describing a reading group they participate in. 

The author's primary claim is that the most important change in human history
is the adoption of an optimimstic mindset in the Enlightenment; that it's
possible to improve the world, and that the way to do so is to discover better
explanations for how the world operates.

I enjoyed some of the book. In particular, I appreciated the discussion of how
anthropic, fine-tuning arguments for the creation of the universe isn't
mathematically rigorous. The sets being discussed lack a natural measure, so
there aren't principled ways of talking about what fraction of possible
universes have certain properties.

However, I don't think the author is a very good historian or philosopher, and
a number of the arguments he makes struck me as naive. For instance, it's
drastically oversimplifying to say that the Enlightenment is the only time in
human history that people have ever adopted this idea, and discarding all other
explanations without real consideration is superficial.

Physicist's "theory of everything" book discussing the central role of cultural
progress, optimism that the world can be improved, to the success of society.
He traces this "beginning of infinity" to the Enlightenment, and that societies
can be classified as either pre- or post- this beginning of infinity. This
infinity is the process of constantly identifying better and better
explanations of the world, which he defines as a theory that is consistent with
observed phenomena, and is difficult to vary.

However, overall, I found the philosophy and history to be amateurish. As
a physicist, he seemed focused on identifying a single explanation for many
diverse processes, and much of it felt forced and rang hollow to me.
