Adam Tooze's investigation into the economic context that gave shape to the
Third Reich's preparations for, and execution of, the Second World War. It is
clearly a wonderfully researched work and, typically for Tooze, effectively
balances detailed statistics with a cohesive, insightful and novel narrative.

Some things that stood out to me:

- The successful Blitzkreig invasion of France and the low countries hinged,
  not on German technological sophistication or quality of the Wehrmacht, but
  on successful Napoleonic tactics (achieve overwhelming force in one area) in
  driving through the Ardenne, which enabled encirclement of Allied forces,
  surrender of more than a million soldiers. If the Allied forces had responded
  optimally, they could have pincered the German front and likely ended the
  war.

- There was never a coherent German strategy that had a reasonable chance of
  victory. Hitler was just an an anti-Semitic paranoid, and saw a worldwide
  Jewish conspiracy that was seeking to crush the German state, and so thought
  war was inevitable; it was just a matter of choosing the time for it that
  maximized Germany's (slim) chances of victory.

- Hitler opted for invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) to
  obtain raw materials necessary for the war effort (Ukrainian wheat, oil from
  the Caucauses) rather than obtain those by negotation with the Soviet Union
  because doing so would have put Germany into a subservient position to the
  Soviet Union. This is a contrast to the way that Great Britain and the
  western alliance sold off everything to secure American backing of the war
  effort.

- German industrial leaders doubled down on their suport for the Third Reich
  despite the failing war effort out of fear for their personal positions were
  the Red Army to conquer Germany and the communist Soviet Union come to power
  in Germany.

- The Soviet Union technologically outclassed the Wehrmacht on the Eastern
  Front. This was a result of Stalin's succcessful rapid industrialization of
  the country in the two decades since he came to power. For instance, the T34
  was much more capable than German Panzers, and the Wermacht still depended on
  horses to move much of their equipment on both fronts. The Soviet Union had
  an advantage in both quality and quantity of armaments.

- Foreign exchange was an important consideration through the buildup to the
  war. Germany owed considerable repararations, depended on exports for foreign
  exchange, and needed foreign exchange for a number of critical raw materials
  that were not available domestically. Up through the later 1930s western
  countries continued to provide Germany with raw materials through trade, even
  though they were increasingly going towards rearmament.
