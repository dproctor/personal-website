Two lectures from Stanford professor, published in 1997, discussing the
evolution of the American Left in the latter half of the 20th century. He
argues that the Reformist Left that won battles against the country's
selfishness and sadism through the New Deal, Great Society, Civil Rights
Movement, etc has been eclipsed by a Cultural Left, a pessimistic reaction to
foreign and domestic failures, e.g. the Vietnam War, that holds that the
United States is irretrievably corrupt. This Cultural Left has retreated to the
Academy and no longer has the confidence to engage politically. 

Clear, approachable thinking.

The author highlights Walt Whitman and John Dewey as powerful proponents of an
optimistic, proud conception of American identity as a country working towards
greater social justice.
