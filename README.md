## Books

I use a Jekyll blog to record notes on books that I've read.

I first add books to my reading list in `books.markdown`, then move them to a
post at `_posts/${book-title}` when I start the book. I collect thoughts there
as I read, and then publish the book at `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-${book-title}` when
I complete the book.

### TODO

- [ ] Investigate whether there is a way to unify this with remarkable,
  academic papers.
