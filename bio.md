Devon is a software engineer who has spent nearly twenty years studying machine learning and building systems that use machine learning to solve important problems. Since being introduced to the field through independent study of MIT OpenCourseWare courses in high school and after earning degrees in Math, Computational Science, Economics, and Statistics from Stanford University, Devon has worked as a software engineer on impactful and complex machine learning problems. This includes time spent at Google in the Search, Google[x], and Machine Intelligence organizations, leading engineering at a machine learning based civic tech company, organizing a COVID-19 pandemic response project involving more than two dozen engineers, scientists, and other volunteers, a short stint spent designing the next generation of machine learning integrations in financial infrastructure at Stripe, and most recently, serving as a founding engineer at a venture backed start-up building technology for machine learning based RNA vaccine design.
