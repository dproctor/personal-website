Physicist's "theory of everything" book discussing the central role of cultural
progress, optimism that the world can be improved, to the success of society.
He traces this "beginning of infinity" to the Enlightenment, and that societies
can be classified as either pre- or post- this beginning of infinity. This
infinity is the process of constantly identifying better and better
explanations of the world, which he defines as a theory that is consistent with
observed phenomena, and is difficult to vary.

There are a few interesting chapters, particularly the dismantling of anthropic
principles based on shortcomings in those theories' ignorance of measures over
uncountable sets.

However, overall, I found the philosophy and history to be amateurish. As
a physicist, he seemed focused on identifying a single explanation for many
diverse processes, and much of it felt forced and rang hollow to me.
